# WhoScored!

WhoSocred! is web app I created as a Capstone Project in Web Dev Course of Dr. Angela Yu. In this project I worked with JavaScript, NodeJS (Express, EJS, Body-Parser, Axios) and CSS (Bootstrap). Data for the site are from https://www.football-data.org/index.

## Introduction
Being both a football enthusiast and player, I often find myself wanting quick access to information about the top football leagues, their current matchdays, league standings, and the leading goal scorers. WhoScored! is the solution to that need.
This project is not just a capstone; it's a practical application born out of personal necessity. As a football fan, I wanted a centralized platform where I could effortlessly check the latest matchday fixtures, follow live scores, and stay informed about league tables and top scorers across the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1.
